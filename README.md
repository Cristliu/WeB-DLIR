# WeB-DLIR

## 1. Getting started

- All methods are implemented in Python (Python 3.6+).

- All required libraries are listed at the beginning of the files in `import`. Particularly, tensorflow-1.14.0, keras-2.2.4.

## 2. Testing
- Make sure to unzip all the zip files to get the datasets.

- Run the `.py` files on the workstation with GPU and the `.ipynb` files on the jupyter notebook.

- Create the necessary `log, model, results, html`, etc. folders to save the outputs or results.

- View the outputs by running the interactive `.ipynb`, and warnings can be ignored.
